### Pre-Prep:
- Know what disciplines you're good at, and know what you like. Networking? Backend? Frontend? Animation? Java/C++/PHP/C#
- Do relevant, personal, and non-tutorial projects that relate to what you're good at / like. Also be able to talk about these, the point (apart from enjoying the project and learning...) is that it can help on your CV selection process, and being able to talk about your interests in the interview is incredible for bonding and vibe-checking.
- Have your work visible (github, blogs, videos)

### Technical Interview:
- Explain your code and thought process out loud. Look up "Rubber duck programming"
- Use a whiteboard to draw out your thoughts and UML / Relational thinking for your problem
- Know your rules for time complexities / the shortcuts for guessing time complexities (there are a few small things you can know off-rip)

### Prep:
- Make a general/master CV (EVERYTHING you're good at, all relevant projects)
- Only submit a cover letter if you actually are interested in the company's work / methods (try to not do the general cover letter method...)
- Make a smaller, specific cv for each type of job you apply for, backend / frontend / programming / animation etc. LINK TO THE RIGHT PROJECTS AND SOCIAL MEDIAS HERE! If you're art: artstation, instagram. If you're programming: github, blog etc.
- Real linkedin page (if you have it, try to be active and like stuff or post work) / real github profile (good time to make your commits higher quality), if you link to it in the CV, make it look nice.

### Do Interviews anyways:
- Ai Interview Websites
- Get peers to mock interview you
- Do interviews at places you don't care about, much longer process, might just get you a job anyways 
- Watch mock interviews on youtube (this is NOT a replacement for the rest, this is a supplemental step)
